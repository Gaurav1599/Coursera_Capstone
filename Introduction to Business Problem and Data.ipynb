I currently live within walking distance to Downtown Telok Ayer MRT metro station and I enjoy many ammenities and venues in the area, such as various international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. I have been offered a great opportunity to work for a leader firm in Manhattan, NY. I am very excited and I want to use this opportunity to practice my learnings in Coursera in order to answer relevant questions arisen. The key question is : How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place similar to mine now in Singapore? Certainly, I can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:\n\n-apartment must be 2 or 3 bedrooms\n\n-desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) radius\n\n-price of rent not exceed $7,000 per month\n\n-top ammenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence\n\n-desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, restaurants Asian Thai, wine stores, gym and food shops"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Business Problem"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The challenge is to find a suitable apartment for rent in Manhattan NY that complies with the demands on location, price and venues."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Interested Audience"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "I believe this is a relevant challenge with valid questions for anyone moving to other large city in US, EU or Asia.
